### Hello! üëã
I'm a business student that loves to learn. Man of many talents (humble brag): A **self taught designer, programmer and data science enthusiast**. I also love selling people crazy ideas!

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on - Fullstack Machine Learning Projects- Hopefully a public website that uses ML for something useful!
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning -  Cloud technologies (mostly Azure), Deep Learning using PyTorch and Tensorflow, how to win Kaggle Competitions
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have a thing for mechanical keyboards - an obsession really and I'm super funny (at least some times)!

### Projects I'm proud of! üòÅ
- [Pragmatic Python on Medium](https://medium.com/@shuvo_11323) - a series of practical Python tutorials for non software engineers!
- [The State of Chicago‚Äôs Taxis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shuvo.saha3090/viz/ChicagoTripsVisualization/Story1) - A data story about the decline of Chicago‚Äôs taxis using 202 million taxi trips from Chicago open data; it was found that the roles of taxis are changing and they are now only used when ride sharing services are not convenient/expensive 
- [Video Games: What Sells?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shuvo.saha3090/viz/VGAnalysis/VGAnalysis) - A dive into what factors influence sales in the Video Game industry using 17k game reviews from Kaggle; it was found that review scores generally have no impact on game sales and game developers are likely to sell their games more when they develop M rated titles or games for Nintendo consoles 
- [Retail Analytics Showcase](https://github.com/Shuvo-saha/Retail-Analytics-Showcase) - An interactive web-app that goes into the use cases of retail analytics such as product recommendations and churn prediction; this project also aims to teach and use various statistical techniques that are used in retail analytics such as collaborative filtering, decision trees, ensemble methods, k-means clustering and PCA
