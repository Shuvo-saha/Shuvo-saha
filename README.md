### Hello! 👋
I'm a business student that loves to learn. Man of many talents (humble brag): A self taught designer, programmer and data science enthusiast. I also love selling people crazy ideas!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on - Fullstack Machine Learning Projects- Hopefully a public website that uses ML for something useful!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning -  Cloud technologies (mostly Azure), Deep Learning using PyTorch and Tensorflow, how to win Kaggle Competitions
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a thing for mechanical keyboards - an obsession really and I'm super funny (at least some times)!

### Projects I'm proud of! 😁
- [Pragmatic Python on Medium](https://medium.com/@shuvo_11323) - a series of practical Python tutorials for non software engineers!
- [Video Game Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shuvo.saha3090/viz/VGAnalysis/VGAnalysis) - a report/dashboard that dives into what effects Video Game sales!
